## ❤️ Heart Health Detection

📝 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to analyze heartbeat audio data and predict potential heart-related diseases. By utilizing audio data from two sets of heartbeat recordings, the model identifies patterns associated with different heart conditions.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Folders:** The dataset consists of two folders, `set_a` and `set_b`, containing heartbeat audio files.
- **CSV Files:**
  - `set_a.csv`: Metadata for `set_a`.
  - `set_b.csv`: Metadata for `set_b`.
  - `set_a_timing.csv`: Timing information for `set_a` recordings.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze and preprocess the audio files to extract meaningful features.
2. Train a machine learning model to classify heart health conditions.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and optimize it for better accuracy.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV for image processing
- Librosa for audio processing
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Audio file loading and noise reduction.
   - Feature extraction using MFCCs, Spectrograms, etc.
2. **Model Training:**
   - Classification using CNN, RNN, or LSTM.
   - Evaluation through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
3. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy obtained: *To be updated after testing.*

##🚀 Future Scope
- Integrating real-time heart monitoring systems.
- Enhancing the model to detect more complex heart conditions.
